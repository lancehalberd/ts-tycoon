Features:
    [L] Split core job abilities into multiple jewels with different values. Better hires can have more fixed jewels. Some abilities are shared between job pools like +1 str/level or 5% magic resist.
    [L] Help system where fairy floats on top of other UIs to give advice, during item/jewel crafting, world map, etc.
    [L] Add option for Pantheon dialogue at quest shrines.
    [L] Death recap for quests. Maybe not important with the more hands on gameplay.

Editor Improvements:
    [H] Add test characters grouped by mission
        - Add average characters for each mission, they can be used as strong/weak versions for other missions
        - Export to clipboard/import from clipboard
        - Export jewelboard as bonuses object+abilities array (disable jewel board on test chars)

        - When removing test char, put the original selected char in place of test char.
        - Could worry about deleting test char canvases to avoid memory leak, but not important. We do need to do this for Person enemies since they will get created/destroyed in the game.

    [H] Add NPC placement (to be used with tracker in mission 2)

Notes:
Using imagemagick montage to convert animated gif to sprite sheet:
XXX This skewed the image: montage -geometry 30x60+1+1 -background transparent musicAnimation.gif montage.png
This is pretty good, but the first frame was too high for some reason, also there are 2 pixels between each frame...
montage musicAnimation.gif -tile x1 -geometry '1x1+1+1<' -background transparent montage2.png
