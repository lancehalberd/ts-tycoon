    [M] Fix flat guild walls need to block movement.
    [M] Add new guild furniture:
        Enchanting pedestal
        Carpenter bench (No graphics for this yet actually)

    [M] Add pillar decorations.
    [M] Fix flat walls need different bounding rules than angled walls.
    [L] Fix guild side doors block movement and have broken depth sorting.
    [L] Update charge shot to allow you to manually charge the hit for % increased damage + accuracy. Remove cooldown?
        This could be applied to some other abilities like "aim"

    [L] Improve enchantment outcomes by giving (C * [itemLevel - enchantmentLevel])% chance to upgrade an enchantment tier, and repeat untiil the upgrade roll fails. C should probably be something like 3-5%

Features:
    [L] Split core job abilities into multiple jewels with different values. Better hires can have more fixed jewels. Some abilities are shared between job pools like +1 str/level or 5% magic resist.
    [L] Help system where fairy floats on top of other UIs to give advice, during item/jewel crafting, world map, etc.
    [L] Add option for Pantheon dialogue at quest shrines.
    [L] Death recap for quests. Maybe not important with the more hands on gameplay.

Endless Adventure:
    * Players will get endless adventure specific progression and passive bonuses that let them advance without significantly impacting the difficulty of the game story.

    Rewards:
        Manual Rewards: Only granted through manual encounters, like puzzles + trap gauntlets which are placed next to way points for easy access and indicated in the waypoint description whether they are completed. These are things that would be annoying if they accumulated automatically like jewels and max affixed rare equipment. These encounters can also give other rewards.

        Unique Rewards: (found after puzzles/trap gauntlets, dungeon boss fights)
            Relics (unique items that give interesting bonuses that may vary between endless adventure and the main game)
            Trophies/banners or trophy/banner upgrades for guild.
            (If no available unique reward, gives big reward instead).
            Endless Adventure Passive Skill Point (up to 3 per level)
                Endless Adventure Passive Web:
                    Possibly infinite passive tree where points are arranged spatially and you spend resources to connect nodes based on distance from eachother, can also create empty nodes to try to optimize connections. Cost of edges is linear, so the shorter your paths are the more passives you can obtain. For a given collections of passives you would ideally try to find the minimal spanning tree, which is a computationally difficult problem to solve.
        Big Rewards: (found after puzzles/trap gauntlets, boss fights and ambushes)
            Passive improvements, things like (3 strength and 3% increased strength) for str/dex/int health, armor, block/mblock, evasion, accuracy.
            Rare seeds/food
            Divinity based on level of area at least 10, up to 20% of base divinity cost for current level.
            Passive respec points based on level (only if at maximum passive skill points for current level)
        Medium Rewards (found in basic dead ends, or in addition to larger rewards, and small rewards have 10% chance to upgrade to medium rewards):
            Normal Seeds/food
            Large coin/anima rewards (like quest chests)
            5 min buffs (damage, defense, speed, increased coins/anima)
            Map + Compass for current area?
        Small Rewards (found randomly in any area, or in addition to larger rewards)


        Some set of relics can be found in small reward


Graphics:
    [M] Arrange HUD so skill tooltips+mission quest don't overlap. Remove minimap.
    [L] Add sparkles to gold+platinum trophies.

    Add furniture glow:
            I'll touch these up later most likely, but this is a bunch of glows for all the different upgradeable furniture when they are ready to be upgraded.
        They are the same canvas size, so you can put the glow behind the furniture and it should give it a glowing hue like the sample.
        The glow is animated with 3 frames, going 1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2-...
        I imagine you can make the glow around like 3 frames a second or something not too quick.
        The glow made works for all tiers of the furniture's upgrades, since usually it doesn't change size too much. If we don't think it looks good using the same glow for tier 1 and tier 2 glows I can change it, but for right now that's how it is just to see if it works at all.

Abilities:
    [M] Try making ricochet bounce off walls if any are in the correct range.

Editor Improvements:
    [H] Add additional assets (decorations+objects) like rocks, bushes
    [H] Add properties panel for selected objects:
        location/alignment (add alignment to monsters)
        parentKey (add to monsters)
        flipped
        object specific properties, similar to object specific context menu
    [H] Add NPC placement (to be used with tracker in mission 2)
    [H] Add Ally placement (to be used with villagers in mission 3)
    [M] Add PositionQueue objects to editor that can be used for controlling where NPCs are positioned and where actors appear/move to in cutscenes.
    [M] Object property panel
        - text input (key, area key)
        - update references when key changes
        - dropdown menu for animation/monster type, etc uses context menu.
        - number input for monster level, area width, x, y, z
        - toggle for flipped
    [M] Set parent key + alignment on objects/monsters
    [L] Add library of object groups (like niche+candle+flame)

Missions:
    Opening Sequence:
        Start with an NPC that has several abilities in a simple dungeon with a few short cutscenes so that people can see game play straight away. Add context menu option to skip this (leave this in for inquisitive players).
    Heal:
        Healing totems that require dealing magic damage to interrupt channeled heal spell to defeat.
            * Update heal to always be AoE but more effective on the main target.
        Give player the heal spell during the quest and have them use it to complete the area
            * Optional Area with powerful ally+enemies where you heal ally to win
            * Optional Area with glass cannon ally that you tank for and heal yourself to win
            * Boss that summons healing totems as seen in the entrance.
            * Allies from previous area will attack the boss if they survived.

                      tanky ally
                          |
            entrance -- shrine -- boss
                          |
                   glass cannon ally

        Add overlay text with large font and transparent background, maybe dark blue,
        reuse for mission Start/Complete text?
        "Only the strong or the clever may attempt this trial."
        "Prove you are worthy of this blessing."
        Both allies survived: "A worthy challenger at last? We shall see..."
        One ally survived: "My guardian will test you."
        No allies: "You think you can defeat my guardian alone?"

        "You are worthy. Return to my shrine if you would seek my blessing."

    Sap (steals health + slows targets):
        * Update slow to reduce block+evasion by the slow %.
        Enemies have a telegraphed aoe root.
        * Update root to reduce evasion by 50%
        Enemies have ranged attack with the sap effect.

        Boss uses a large version of the telegraphed root that hits 8-12 spots on the screen
        Boss spawns relatively weak eggs that spawn enemies if not defeated quickly.

    Vitality (gives STR based health regen over time):
        Enemies have moderate block+mblock which favors monks high damage per hit.
        Enemies have telegraphed ranged stun (1s) that favors naive melee behavior which will cause heroes to run past the initial stun.
        At 75/50/25% health boss summons 1/2/3 enemies at 2s intervals to stagger their stun abilities.

    3: Defeat bandits attacking village
    4: Find the bandits hideout and defeat the leader
    5+ assist other villages/cities/the king

Cutscenes:
    [H] Guild Spirit explains Shrine Quests so you can get strong enough to clear out the guild hall.
        Dialogue: (before level 2) + Guild spirit reminds you to be careful when choosing which shrine to activate.
        Dialogue: (after level 2) + Guild spirit suggests crafting new armor before clearing the hall.
    [M] Guild Spirit moves to Guild Hall and explains the Shrine of Creation.
        Dialogue: GS: You can obtain additional jewels and divinity for each guild member that completes a new Shrine Quest, even if they don't request a blessing from the Pantheon.
    [M] Sprite tells you she has applications from Ruthven, and places them on the board
        - This occurs only after mission 2 outro is completed, character is level 2.
        - She will remind you that you cannot hire any new members until the guest room is unlocked.
        - Disable the first shrine quests until Guild Spirit explains Shrine Quests.
    [L] Guild Spirit explains enchanting gear after mission 4.
    [L] Automatically make cutscene characters face whoever is speaking. Add some override to prevent this when desired.

Notes:
Using imagemagick montage to convert animated gif to sprite sheet:
XXX This skewed the image: montage -geometry 30x60+1+1 -background transparent musicAnimation.gif montage.png
This is pretty good, but the first frame was too high for some reason, also there are 2 pixels between each frame...
