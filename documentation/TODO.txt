    [L] Add "Endless Discovery" section off of the guild exit to replace autofarming
        - Randomly generated seed for each character
        - Maps to the globe so areas get harder as you move north, and you can go in circles at latitude to fight monsters of similar difficulty but different composition.
        - Rewards can be found periodically but can each be obtained only once. Can get jewels, equipment and even permanent buffs for character.
        - *maybe* include entrances to quest shrines? Finding them would unlock them on the world map for that character.

    [H] Add NPC placement (to be used with tracker in mission 2)
    [H] Add Ally placement (to be used with villagers in mission 3)
    [M] Add PositionQueue objects to editor that can be used for controlling where NPCs are positioned and where actors appear/move to in cutscenes.
    [M] Object property panel
        - text input (key, area key)
        - update references when key changes

Missions:
    Opening Sequence:
        Start with an NPC that has several abilities in a simple dungeon with a few short cutscenes so that people can see game play straight away. Add context menu option to skip this (leave this in for inquisitive players).
    Heal:
        Healing totems that require dealing magic damage to interrupt channeled heal spell to defeat.
            * Update heal to always be AoE but more effective on the main target.
        Give player the heal spell during the quest and have them use it to complete the area
            * Optional Area with powerful ally+enemies where you heal ally to win
            * Optional Area with glass cannon ally that you tank for and heal yourself to win
            * Boss that summons healing totems as seen in the entrance.
            * Allies from previous area will attack the boss if they survived.

                      tanky ally
                          |
            entrance -- shrine -- boss
                          |
                   glass cannon ally

        Add overlay text with large font and transparent background, maybe dark blue,
        reuse for mission Start/Complete text?
        "Only the strong or the clever may attempt this trial."
        "Prove you are worthy of this blessing."
        Both allies survived: "A worthy challenger at last? We shall see..."
        One ally survived: "My guardian will test you."
        No allies: "You think you can defeat my guardian alone?"

        "You are worthy. Return to my shrine if you would seek my blessing."

    Sap (steals health + slows targets):
        * Update slow to reduce block+evasion by the slow %.
        Enemies have a telegraphed aoe root.
        * Update root to reduce evasion by 50%
        Enemies have ranged attack with the sap effect.

        Boss uses a large version of the telegraphed root that hits 8-12 spots on the screen
        Boss spawns relatively weak eggs that spawn enemies if not defeated quickly.

    Vitality (gives STR based health regen over time):
        Enemies have moderate block+mblock which favors monks high damage per hit.
        Enemies have telegraphed ranged stun (1s) that favors naive melee behavior which will cause heroes to run past the initial stun.
        At 75/50/25% health boss summons 1/2/3 enemies at 2s intervals to stagger their stun abilities.

    3: Defeat bandits attacking village
    4: Find the bandits hideout and defeat the leader
    5+ assist other villages/cities/the king

Cutscenes:
    [H] Guild Spirit explains Shrine Quests so you can get strong enough to clear out the guild hall.
        Dialogue: (before level 2) + Guild spirit reminds you to be careful when choosing which shrine to activate.
        Dialogue: (after level 2) + Guild spirit suggests crafting new armor before clearing the hall.
    [M] Guild Spirit moves to Guild Hall and explains the Shrine of Creation.
        Dialogue: GS: You can obtain additional jewels and divinity for each guild member that completes a new Shrine Quest, even if they don't request a blessing from the Pantheon.
    [M] Sprite tells you she has applications from Ruthven, and places them on the board
        - This occurs only after mission 2 outro is completed, character is level 2.
        - She will remind you that you cannot hire any new members until the guest room is unlocked.
        - Disable the first shrine quests until Guild Spirit explains Shrine Quests.
    [L] Guild Spirit explains enchanting gear after mission 4.
    [L] Automatically make cutscene characters face whoever is speaking. Add some override to prevent this when desired.

Notes:
Using imagemagick montage to convert animated gif to sprite sheet:
XXX This skewed the image: montage -geometry 30x60+1+1 -background transparent musicAnimation.gif montage.png
This is pretty good, but the first frame was too high for some reason, also there are 2 pixels between each frame...
montage musicAnimation.gif -tile x1 -geometry '1x1+1+1<' -background transparent montage2.png
